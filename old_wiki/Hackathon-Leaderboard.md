## DNS

Ask Sam to create a dns entry for the hackathon and point it to the server that all hackathons are served from. Currently all are hosted from the same one which is `34.246.2.4`. The scheme for the domains are like this: `hackathon-01.batch2.lisbondatascience.org`.

## Releasing a new leaderboard

Follow the [README](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-hackathon-leaderboard) in the leaderboard repo.
