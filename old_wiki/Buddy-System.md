## Inspiration

Last academy was a success in many different ways but there is one in particular that wasn’t: our graduation rate. If we have this into account, we have to say we did an ok job for the first academy but we have a long road ahead of us. Because of this and my personal experience as a student, I know it will be hard to get until the end of the academy. It requires work and dedication during half a year, and that’s hard. 

As an organization, we need to carve for the number of students we graduate! This should be one of the most important success metrics of the academy! It won’t matter if we have great material, great teachers and companies if our students are not reaching the end. 


## Buddy Program

It consists mostly in having a buddy inside the organization. This is not a technical buddy, this is not a mentor that should tell students what to do or “nag students” when they are not following the plans. This is an empathy based program that aims for Buddies to understand what students are feeling during the academy. (Obviously it can end up with some geek talk but that is not the aim of the program!)


## Buddy tasks

Each buddy will have 5-6 students to follow throughout the entire academy.

The first thing you should do when assigned as someone's buddy is to send them a message that covers the following points:

- I am your point of contact in case you are feeling frustrated or not seeing a path to success for yourself.
- Feel free to message me any time, we want to know if you are feeling discouraged so that we can know what to do in order to keep you motivated and inspired.
- I'll be dropping you messages every once in a while to see how things are going. Not because I'm pressuring you, just because I would like to make sure that you are having fun and feeling like you're making progress.
- I'm not your point of contact for all technical things because that stuff goes through the issue boards and specialized slack channels. 

Take 5 minutes to craft those points into your own words in order to keep it sincere.

## Goals after the bootcamp

### Main goal

Make sure they don’t feel “alone”, be a friend listening to their difficulties and motivate them to get to each hackathon!

### Guidelines

Check if they are making progress on the materials before the hackathon - you can do this one week before the hackathon and drop them a message/call and understand why they are not doing it. 

Remember: Giving up is a lag indicator of something that was wrong before. Look for those signals.

Report to Ricardo in case someone misses the deliveries regularly and/or the hackathons without a good reason.

## Amount of work for instructors

This is NOT a lot of work for instructors. This is just something where you send a few messages to someone every few weeks to make sure that they are not totally being left behind.
