# Job offer instructions 

## Context  
The Lisbon Data Science Academy is a non-profit in Lisbon, Portugal. We help students learn data science, and promote a community around this field. As part of this, we are letting companies reach data scientists of every level. It is 100% free, both for the students and for the organizations hiring. 

## Who can submit job offers?
Any company, non-profit or government agency, anywhere in the world (though our community is mainly in Portugal). Startups that are not incorporated can still potentially post positions, at the Academy's discretion. 
The only exception are companies that have previously had their job offers rejected, for failing to comply with our requirements. 

## What kind of job offers can I submit? 
Job offers must be for data science or data engineering related positions. Please do not submit offers for positions not related to these two fields. If in doubt, contact us first :) 

## What do I need to do?
1. Read and understand these instructions. There will be a pop quiz at the end! (just kidding) 
2. Draft your job offer using [this form](https://forms.gle/nCVBQFbCF5QaxCZq6). 
    - We will then turn it into a [template like this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_Ju1RamXB1zgkDVAdamBuoXBiX0-zhlXp1KRSiT7kc/edit?usp=sharing). 
    - Please ensure that it complies with all rules. 
    - The questions are based on [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HcJ9PtLP4Ks_-O7d9ykCJKZJraciLqkugBH6UoOpH4s/edit?pli=1#heading=h.9h9v9ad3ke2i), where we researched what applicants care about, so please take a look at it before getting started. If the questions require information your organization is not comfortable sharing, then it's good we caught it early, and saved everyone some time :) 
4. Someone will reach out to you for corrections / alterations, if any are needed. 
5. One of our volunteers will add your company to the jobs page, with a link to a copy of the job offer. 
6. Once the position has been filled or become obsolete, you will let us know, and we will take it down (this is not optional as we don't want obsolete offers). You can also ask us to take it down at any time, at your discretion. 
7. If after 45 days we haven't heard from you, we will take the offer down, but any applicant with a copy of the job offer will continue to have access to it. If you like, you can ask us to remove everyone's access to that job offer.

## FAQ

#### How does the Academy make money from this? 
It doesn't. We're fine financially, and just want to do this to give back to the community. 

#### What are Academy sponsors? 
If any staff from the Academy actively recommends your company, we will allow them to express that on the page. That will help with student's trust. 

#### Boy oh boy, do I have questions! 
If you have questions please feel free to contact us at jobs[at]lisbondatascience.org.  
We ask that you read these instructions fully first, as emails asking "how does it work" will get saved as pdf, printed, cut into small pieces, stewed with some sweet potatoes and eaten by the staff.
