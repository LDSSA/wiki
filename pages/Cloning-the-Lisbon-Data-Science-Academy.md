# Cloning the academy

The Lisbon Data Science Academy is, as a matter of strategy, not looking to grown its own organization. We like the quality of education that we provide to our students and our community and feel that growing may sacrifice that. However, we get many more applications than we can possibly serve with our 50-students-per-year course.

So, instead of growing, we are actively encouraging being cloned. With this approach, we believe that it is possible for our ideas to spread while keeping focus on providing the highest quality possible individual communities that may have different requirements than communities that exist in Lisbon.

# Steps

## Recruit Essential Positions

We have several [Areas of Responsibility](./pages/LDSA-Areas-of-Responsibility) that have Primary Enablers. Some of them are more defined than others but there's a few Primary Enabler positions that need to be filled in the following order:

1. Organizational Admin - This includes a president who is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in the academy and is responsible for recruiting all other AOR positions and ensuring that they do their job. Also, if any tasks show up that were not planned for, this person must either do them or recruit new or existing members to get them done. This position is a LOT of work and requires good communication and leadership skills as coordinating a bunch of super smart and hyper critical data scientists is... rewarding...
1. Finance - This is a legal requirement and should be taken *very seriously*. This person is in charge of keeping tabs on the financial health of the organization as well as ensuring that the organization is legally compliant in all senses.
1. Teaching - This person ensures that the teaching material is delivered with quality to the students.
1. Dev-Ops - This person is responsible for all things infrastructure. If you decide to run a student portal, they must run the portal. If students are having a hard time setting up their machines, this person must be available and have the availability to help them. The AOR is a bit badly named though because they do so much it really ends up being more than dev-ops. This is heavy on infrastructure and the engineering skills required are significant though it is not like to be many hours of work.
1. Student Success - This person ensures that the organization keeps track of how all of the students are doing and finding extra help for those that may need it. You should never be surprised by a dropout and filling this position with a very empathetic person is the best way to achieve this.
1. Marketing - For the first edition this won't be a hugely intensive AOR but there does need to be someone in charge of putting up a website, making some social media posts, and ensuring that the word gets out before launching. 
1. Operations - Since there are several in-person events that are run, there is quite a bit of coordination and project management that needs to be done.
1. Partnerships - A large part of the fun is having the bootcamp and several 

Notice that there are a few AORs missing here, in particular Curriculum Development and that is because the work here is done with the LDSA and this does not need to be done by a clone. 

## Set a calendar

Now that you've got the core team together, you should set a calendar for the course. The most important things to select

1. Applications
1. Course start date (and thus the start of the bootcamp)
1. The dates of each of the hackathons
1. The dates of the capstone and thus graduation

You can see [here an example of the schedule](./pages/Starters-Academy-(Course)#schedule) that was made before the start of batch3.

## Recruit Teachers

There are 19 SLUs and 5 months of BLUs as well as a capstone that need to be delivered. This is usually considered the most fun work of the academy but it requires a lot of time! The best way to go about this would be to use your network to qualified data scientists that want to teach the material that is already created. Since we already have all of the material created, it's relatively easy to just point to it and ask if they want to take care of it. People that are specialized or are more comfortable with certain material will naturally gravitate to it and this is 100% okay!

One important note is that you don't need to recruit all of the teachers for the entire bootcamp at once. You can (and probably should) recruit incrementally and cover only what you have for the next weeks or month.

## Run the course!
