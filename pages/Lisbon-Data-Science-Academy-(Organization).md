# Lisbon Data Science Academy
The Lisbon Data Science Academy (_"The Academy"_ or _"LDSA"_) is a not-for-profit organization. 

It was started in June 2017 by a group of [volunteers](#organizing-body) who love data science. The organization runs the [Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy](pages/Starters-Academy-(Course)), a course for python programmers who wish to enter Data Science. 

The scope of the organization may grow through time. For now, that's all it does. For a complete description, read the [LDSA Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDQF8lFZA0DYKhru57rxLI4d7s3ReiN90BFdjTHtP-Q/edit)
