## Batch3 Student Onboarding

Welcome Batch3 students of the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy! This wiki page will be the entry point into the community of the Lisbon Data Science Academy.

### Important people to know

Though we have a volunteer staff of about 20, there are a few of us that will be interacting directly with students a bit more often so you should probably know of their existence:

1. [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-hopkins-01914364/) - El Presidente. He's ultimately responsible for all the things (good and bad) so hit him up if you've got big ideas of how things are going.
1. [Chi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-cristina-dominguez-3a09ab106/) - Head Teacher. Chi is responsible for ensuring that learning material is delivered on time and with quality.
1. [Surabhi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surabhi-r-03041a24/) - Community Lead. Community is central to our mission and she is here to make sure that everyone feels a part of it.
1. [Catarina Freitas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catarinacfreitas/) - Student Success. Catarina is in charge of ensuring that Students have a feasible path to success in the Academy.
