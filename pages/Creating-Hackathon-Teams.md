## Announce on slack

Announce on slack who the teams are and ask one member from each team to send you their team name and team gif.

## Prepare the leaderboard

Go to the [admin page](https://hackathon-05.batch2.lisbondatascience.org/admin/) of the hackathon and login. You can get the credentials from Hugo Castilho.

First thing is to select `Submission Limits`

And then select the submission limit (there should only be one and if it doesn't exist, you should create one called 'production')

Then set the number of submission limits that we agreed upon (usually it is 5)

## Make the teams

Once people start sending you the team names and gifs, you will need to add them to the leaderboard!

Then from the main admin page, select `Teams`

Then select the "add team" button

Then add the team and send them the token also on slack

Repeat this until all teams have their tokens. If you feel so inclined to keep a spreadsheet of the tokens and team names that would be most excellent.
