title: How to review a Learning Unit
category: Instructors

Reviewing takes at least 1 to 2 hours, and you are expected to find any mistake that may possibly exist, and also to suggest improvements.

These include:
> - Improvement suggestions (this line could be clearer)
> - Bugs (e.g. a global variable gets used instead of a local one)
> - Lookforward (something the students haven't learned yet is mentioned)
> - Dependency on the presentation (remember: the Learning Notebook is *independent of the presentation*, if you don't mention it in the LN, it does not exist.
> - Code complexity (lots of requests for _"can you break this pandas line down into 4 parts and show the intermediate outputs, so they develop an intuition for it"_)

By the time you are done with the review, the original author should have a lot of improvements to make (and should at least slightly hate your guts). 

Open a google doc when you start, and take notes as you go (slack sucks for this kind of thing). You definitely need to allocate time to going slowly through all of the material, and obviously doing every single exercise. If you haven't filled pages of suggestions, you haven't really reviewed it.

Remember: _if we don't catch the problems, **the students will**._
