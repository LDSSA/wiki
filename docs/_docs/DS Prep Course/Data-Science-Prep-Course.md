# Course overview

The Data Science Prep Course (Prep Course) is a preparation course designed to equip you with prerequisite knowledge for the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy (LDSSA). Having said that, the Prep Course would still be useful for anyone interested in learning Data Science, whether or not it is through Lisbon Data Science Academy (LDSA); or who is simply looking to gain foundational knowledge in Python programming.

It is important to keep in mind that we cannot guarantee that by taking the Prep Course, you will (1) enter Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy or/and (2) secure a job in Tech.

## What will be covered

Python Programming, Python Engineering, `numpy`, Linear Algebra, the *nix command line, Git Basics, Jupyter. You can see the curriculum in more details in this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_WGZA_NFwFNpzl4cnMfN6clHV0Z0OaxCwMTDKCHcEEw/edit#gid=2018895387).

All learning units will be released on the [`ds-prep-course-2024`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2024) repository and you can go through them at your own pace.

## When is the Prep Course
The Prep Course takes place between March 18th, 2024 and June 9th, 2024.

## Fees
The Prep Course is free of charge.

# How does the Prep Course work

## Learning materials
This is a 100% online and 100% remote course that you can take anywhere in your spare time.
New learning materials will be released and shared with you every Monday. Ideally, you will go through them and complete all exercises by the end of the week. When and where you do that is totally up to you! If you cannnot complete a unit within a week, no problem, you can catch up later or just continue at your own pace. There are no deadlines in this course.

## What support will I receive during the course
You have at your availability a group of dedicated instructors who will answer any of your questions in our Slack workspace. On top of that, you will be surrounded by motivated fellow students that can also help you out. Make the most out of the course!

## Time requirements
If you have no prior knowledge of any of the subjects, you should be prepared to spend an absolute minimum of 10 hours per week on the course. We understand that this might sound like a lot. However, this course was not designed to give you some brief ideas on Python programming. Instead, we expect that you will fully grasp all the fundamental concepts and practice enough to instinctively solve programming problems. If you already have a certain degree of knowledge of some topics, the time requirements will be less. Finally, keep in mind that this recommendation does not include the preparation time for the admission test for the Starters Academy.

## Timeline
Since the [schedule](#schedule) is tight, you should do everything that you can in order to complete all exercises by the end of the week, but if you cannot, that is okay! This timeline is a suggestion to help you keep on track. If you fall a bit behind for whatever reason, do everything you can to get back on track! If you feel somewhat lost, or have difficulty catching up, tell us ASAP and we'll help you out. The ultimate measure of success is whether or not you can pass the exam to get into the Starters Academy.

# Schedule
As mentioned previously, this is our suggested schedule to help you keep track of your learning. That being said, feel free to skip certain topics you already know. The other way around, take the time to study the materials that you are not comfortable with.

# Practicalities
Here we will explain how our Slack workspace is organized. Essentially, there will be a Slack channel dedicated to each week's materials, e.g. #setup, #week-01, #week-02, #week-03. Questions should be posted to the right channels, e.g. if you have a question about Week 02, you should go to #week-02 channel and post your questions there.

While it may seem annoying at the moment to have to remember where to post a question, in the future you will GREATLY appreciate it when you are looking for where that one clever answer to that one question is. Furthermore, you'll be very grateful not to have a question about a completely unrelated subject right next to your brilliant one. Trust us, the extra effort is worth it!

# How to ask for help
There is one slack rule to rule them all! Whenever you can, **ASK QUESTIONS PUBLICLY** (on the Slack channel of week-XX for questions related with that week's SLUs, on the general channel for non-SLU related questions, etc.)

We know and totally understand that it can be intimidating to ask a question in front of a bunch of other people that you don't even know. We've all been there and can empathize. However, the rewards of overcoming this fear and asking a question in a slack channel that everyone can see are too great to ignore. The benefits, among others, are:

1. **You will get an answer faster.** If 50 people see your question, you will get an answer faster than if 1 person does.
1. **You will get a better answer.** If 50 people see your question, you're likely get a better answer than if 1 person does.
1. **You may make a friend.** It increases the chances of interacting with an interesting person that you may not have met otherwise. These types of peers can increase your chances of success immensely.
1. **You will help others with the same question.** Very likely someone else has the same question and will be able to benefit from the answer.

On top of that, for your questions to be answered in the shortest possible time, provide us with enough context. Among others, you can attach a screenshot of your terminal or code output together with your questions. If you, as a student, see a question that you know the answer to, just go for it and answer!

# Frequently Asked Questions
