## How will the course work

### Our role

We, the LDSA organization, are playing the role of facilitators much more than teachers for this course. The contents and material that need to be learned here are very commonly taught concepts and can be learned on your own through many of the excellent online-only courses that are currently.

### You and DataQuest

However, since learning by yourself can be difficulty because of the solitude as well as the lack of deadlines, we are here to provide solutions to both of these for you. What this means is that DataQuest is where the vast majority of your learning should take place while we provide some deadlines and the basis for a community of people that are going through the exactly same struggle as you.

### Deadlines and time management

DataQuest is organized into courses. Each of these courses is a self-contained unit that takes about 1.5 hours to complete. We have pre-selected about 20 of them and for each of them assigned a week in which they should be done. Since the schedule is tight, you should do everything that you can in order to meet these deadlines but if you cannot, that is okay! These deadlines are suggestions to help you keep on track. If you fall a bit behind for whatever reason, do everything you can to get back on track! The ultimate measure of success is whether or not you can pass the exam to get into the Starters Academy.

## Slack Usage

### The golden rule

There is one rule to rule them all: ** DON'T BE SHY! ASK QUESTIONS PUBLICLY **

We know and totally understand that it can be intimidating to ask a question in front of a bunch of other people that you don't even know. We've all been there and can empathize. However, the rewards of overcoming this fear and asking a question in a slack channel that everyone can see are too great to ignore. The benefits, among others are:

1. **You will get an answer faster.** If 50 people see your question, you will get an answer faster than if 1 person does.
1. **You may make a friend.** It increases the chances of interacting with an interesting person that you may not have met otherwise. These types of peers can increase your chances of success immensely. 

### Practicalities

Here we will talk about each of the channels available in our slack channel and how they should be used. This is super important because it dictates how important information will be organized. While it may seem annoying at the moment to have to remember where to post a question, the future you will GREATLY appreciate it when you are looking for where that one clever answer to that one question is. Furthermore, you'll be very grateful not to have a question about a completely unrelated subject right next to your brilliant one. Trust us, the extra effort is worth it!

If you have general questions about how dataquest works this is where you would ask them. For example: how do I track my progress in DataQuest? A question that you would not ask here is something very specific about one of the exercises.
