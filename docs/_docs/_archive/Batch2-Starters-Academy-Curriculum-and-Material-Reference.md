# DANGER

This is now officially outdated as it refers to batch2. It is still a useful page because it contains links to everything that was taught in batch2 but the most current curriculum is in the [curriculum-development](https://github.com/LDSSA/curriculum-development) repo.

## Curriculum and Material Reference

This page serves as a quick reference to all of the material that is taught throughout the 6 month starters academy. If a student graduates the academy, then they are certified as having completed to a satisfactory level all of the material found here. Keep in mind that information about the course is found in detail on [this wiki page](pages/Starters-Academy-(Course))

### Bootcamp

The [bootcamp](https://github.com/LDSSA/bootcamp) consists of a series of SLUs (small learning units) with the following topics:

- SLU01_Pandas_101
- SLU02_Subsetting_Data
- SLU03_Transforming_Data
- SLU04_Visualization
- SLU05_Basic_Stats
- SLU06_Intermediate_Statistics
- SLU07_Advanced_Statistics
- SLU08_Data_Problems
- SLU09_Regression
- SLU10_Classification
- SLU11_Model_Validation
- SLU12_Validation_metrics_for_regression
- SLU13_Validation_classification
- SLU14_Algorithms
- SLU15_Working_With_Real_Data
- SLU16_Hyperparameter_Tuning
- SLU17_Data_Sufficiency_And_Selection
- SLU18_Unsupervised_Learning
- SLU19_Basic_Workflow

### Specialization 1 - Binary classification

This is done as part of the bootcamp on the last day and uses the bootcamp SLUs as the supporting material.

### Specialization 2 - Time Series

In this specialization, students learn the basics of working with timeseries data using pandas with a focus on analysis and forecasting. The BLUs (big learning units) are as follows:

- [BLU01](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU01)
- [BLU02](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU02)
- [BLU03](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU03)

### Specialization 3 - Data Wrangling

Anyone that has worked in the real world knows data does not grow nicely on trees in perfect csv format. Therefore we have created a specialization just to allow students to experience the struggle of patching together a dataset from many different sources. 

- [BLU04](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU04)
- [BLU05](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU05)
- [BLU06](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU06)

### Specialization 4 - Text Classification

Working with natural language is a messy task filled with high dimensionality and ambiguity issues. In this specialization the students learned how to take documents and preprocess them into data structures that allow for categorization.  

- [BLU07](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU07)
- [BLU08](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU08)
- [BLU09](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU09)

### Specialization 5 - Recommender Systems

Building recommender systems is one of the most common machine learning tasks in industry and learning them provides a great foundation for data scientists in applied linear algebra. In this specialization, the students learned foundational concepts as well as some higher-level libraries to assist in providing recommendations using tried and true methods.

- [BLU10](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU10)
- [BLU11](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU11)
- [BLU12](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-BLU12)

### Specialization 6 - Deployment Capstone

In the last month of the academy, the students are required to put it all together and then release their predictive models into the real world. In this month-long project, they are required to train a predictive model, write up 2 professional-quality reports mostly containing analysis, and then deploy their model behind an HTTP server while a simulator pings their models with observations and true outcomes that they can use to re-train.

This specialization did not have BLUs like the others but rather a tutorial on how to deploy their models and the capstone brief itself:

- [deploying a model](https://github.com/LDSSA/heroku-model-deploy)
- [capstone brief](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch2-capstone)
