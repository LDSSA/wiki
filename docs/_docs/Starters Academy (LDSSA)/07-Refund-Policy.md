## Refund Policy

As students of Lisbon Data Science Starter Academy (LDSSA), you are eligible for a full refund within 1 month after the [Bootcamp start date](https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/01-Starters-Academy-(Course)/#schedule), if you are not happy with our way of Teaching. 


Now you might be wondering:

**Why the deadline of one month?**

Within one month from the Bootcamp start date, you will get to attend both the Bootcamp and the first Hackathon. What you experience during the first month will be highly similar to the rest of the Academy. Hence, we believe the current deadline is enough time to get a good view of our [Teaching styles](https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/About%20us/Teaching-Philosophy/), and how it would be like to study until the very last day.

**Why no partial refund?**

The refund policy was created for you to evaluate whether LDSSA would be the right fit. It is not intended to accommodate any changes in personal schedule or availability, or not being comfortable with the required workload. Hence, we will not offer any partial refund after the deadline has passed.


## Refund Process

If the refund deadline has not passed, you can ask for a refund by sending an email to `info@lisbondatascience.org`. Within 30 days, you will receive an answer on whether your refund has been accepted or not. 

In the email, please make sure that you include the following information:
* Full Name
* Proof of payment
* Recipient IBAN (The refund can only be made via the same IBAN used to make the payment) 
* Reason for refund - Please explain why you would like to drop out. Let us know if thereâ€™s anything we can improve and make it a better learning experience for you.
