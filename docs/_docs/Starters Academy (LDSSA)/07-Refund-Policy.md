## Refund Policy

As students of Lisbon Data Science Starter Academy (LDSSA), you are eligible for a full refund up to 14 days after the [Bootcamp start date](https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/Starters%20Academy%20(LDSSA)/01-Starters-Academy-(Course)/#schedule). Now you might be wondering:

Now you might be wondering:

**Why the deadline of 14 days?**

Within the first two weeks of the LDSSA, you will get to attend the Bootcamp and start working on the first learning units. What you experience during this time will be highly similar to the rest of the Academy. Hence, we believe the current deadline is enough time to get a good view of our [Teaching styles](https://ldssa.github.io/wiki/About%20us/Teaching-Philosophy/).

**Why no partial refund after the 14 days?**

The refund policy was created for you to evaluate whether LDSSA would be the right fit. It is not intended to accommodate any changes in personal schedule or availability, or not being comfortable with the required workload. Hence, we will not offer any partial refund after the deadline has passed.

**What if I get sick?**

In case of sickness, or other unforeseen events, cases will be evaluated on an ad hoc manner. To request your refund please send an email studentsuccess@lisbondatascience.org including your justification, a note for your medical doctor and any other type of supporting information. Within 30 days, you will receive an answer on whether your refund has been accepted or not. 

## Refund Process

If the refund deadline has not passed, you can ask for a refund by sending an email to studentsuccess@lisbondatascience.org. Within 30 days, you will receive an answer on whether your refund has been accepted or not. 

In the email, please make sure that you include the following information:
* Full Name
* Proof of payments
* Recipient IBAN (The refund can only be made via the same IBAN used to make the payment) 
* Reason for refund (Optional) - Although not required within the 14 days deadline, please let us know why you would like to drop out, if thereâ€™s anything we can improve and how we can make it a better learning experience for you.
