## Structure 

The bootcamp is an intensive set of days where you will learn the basics of data 
science, ranging from useful pandas functions to some common problems like 
regression and classification, and models used to tackle them. It is composed
by 16 units, 14 mandatory, presented in the 2 days that compose the bootcamp, and 2
optional. Together with the first 3 units you should have completed in the admission
process, they compose the set of units of specialization #1.

| SLU12 | Feature Engineering (aka Real Wold Data) | Bootcamp Day 2  |  Yes      |
| SLU13 | Model Selection & Overfitting            | Bootcamp Day 2  |  Yes      |
| SLU14 | Data Sufficiency & Selection             | Bootcamp Day 2  |  Yes      |

| SLU16 | Hyperparameter Tuning                    | Bootcamp Day 2  |  Yes      |
| SLU17 | Workflow                                 | Bootcamp Day 2  |  Yes      |
| SLU18 | Support Vector Machines (SVM)            | Not presented   |  No       |
| SLU19 | k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)                | Not presented   |  No       |

During the days of the bootcamp, each presented unit will follow the following schedule:

- 15 min presentation
- 5 min questions
- 40 min of working time on the unit

However, it is not expected that in the 40 min of working time you complete all of the content, 
it is just a first contact with the content. The bootcamp days are followed by 3 weeks where
you are expected to review the materials and complete all units by yourself.



### Time commitment

Aside from the bootcamp weekend, you should be prepared to spend a recommended *10 hours per week* 
on the bootcamp units throughout the course of the 3 weeks given to complete them.


### Bootcamp Evaluation Rules

In order to pass the bootcamp:

* The student must have been present in the bootcamp days
* All mandatory units should have been submitted and score at least 16/20 until the deadline (see the calendar section below)


### Optional units

There are a few optional units that we recommend the students look at, but that are not mandatory to 
pass the bootcamp. However, they will show up on the final curriculum as either passed/failed. As other
units a passing grade is considered for submissions that score at least 16/20 until the deadlines 
(see the calendar section below).

We advise you to only tackle these after you have completed all mandatory content, since the bootcamp
is essential to proceed with the academy.
