## Structure 

In **Specialisation 1 - Bootcamp and Binary Classification** you learn the basics of data science, 
ranging from useful pandas functions to procedures like data cleaning and common problems 
like regression and classification and the models used to tackle them.
This first specialisation has a different structure than other specialisations. 
It is composed of 3 learning units completed during the admissions and additional 14 mandatory 
and 2 optional learning units which you have to complete in the first three weeks of the Academy`.
The learning units are accompanied by virtual classes presented during 2 days. Participation in the virtual classes is mandatory.

   - SLU15 - Hyperparameter Tuning
Class 6: 
   - SLU16 - Workflow
   - SLU17 - Ethics and Fairness

### Time commitment

Aside from the virtual classes, you should be prepared to spend a recommended *10 hours per week* 
on the bootcamp units throughout the course of the 3 weeks given to complete them.

### Specialisation 1 Evaluation Rules

In order to pass Specialisation 1

* The student must take part in the virtual classes
* The student must score at least 16/20 on the mandatory learning units until the deadline (see the calendar section below)

### Optional units

There are a two optional units teaching additional classification models that we recommend the students look at, 
but that are not mandatory to pass the bootcamp. However, they will show up on the final curriculum as either passed/failed. 
As in other learning units, a passing grade is a score of at least 16/20 submitted until the deadline.
(see the calendar section below). We advise you to only tackle these two units after you have completed all mandatory content, 
since completing Specialisation 1 is essential to proceed with the academy.
