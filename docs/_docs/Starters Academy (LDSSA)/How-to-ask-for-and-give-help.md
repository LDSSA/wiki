# How to ask for help 

During the Academy, you will have technical questions. You will not understand certain concepts and will get in trouble with your exercises. This is not only ok, it's desirable! But how should you ask for help? 

## I'm at the bootcamp, and there are monitors around 
Call them! Always! That's what we're there for! 

## I'm doing my Learning Units at home, and have a question

If something isn't clear to you, it is very likely not to be clear to other people. We use the questions raised to improve the Learning Units iteratively. 

I know the first instinct will be to go to Slack, but (if possible) resist the temptation and follow these steps first:

#### Step 1: mmmmayyybee it's in the Notebooks?
First thing, check the Learning Notebook and example notebooks, more often than not the answer will be there somewhere. 

#### Step 2: StackoverGoogle
If still unclear, try throwing the question into Google (especially if it is a python question!), or seeing what [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) says about it.

#### Step 3: Houston, we have an issue.
Stackoverflow [failed you](https://youtu.be/BsBK3gyMFcw?t=12s)? Oh my. Ok, time to check the issues on the Batch repo, and see if someone might have asked a similar question. Search for the error you are getting, and check the label of the Learning Units you are on.

Remember to check the closed issues, as the default screen will only show the "still unclosed" ones.

#### Step 4: Uuuh, a new issue! Exciting! 
Still nothing? Ok, cool, time to [open a new issue](#how-to-open-an-issue). Remember: do **NOT** post your answer and ask "what's wrong?", as this is a breach of the [Code of Conduct](../../About us/Code-of-Conduct). Except for that, there are *no wrong questions!* You are smart and yet you are confused, so we want to help!  

#### Step 5: If you need to, you can ignore all of this and talk to us. 
If you are shy and would rather talk to an instructor, we can of course talk on slack. We'd always rather you get your questions solved than optimize on the process. However if you follow this process you'll be helping others and making the Academy better for the next generation too!


## I have a Python or devops question, which isn't directly about the material I'm studying
If you are blocked on a Python or devops question, do the following: 
1. Google the problem! StackOverflow is your friend! 
1. If that doesn't work, ask it on Slack. 

## I have a data science question, but it's not specifically about any Learning Unit 
Please use a general channel on Slack (e.g. #random).

## How to open an issue 
To open an issue, click on the Issues tab of the Github repo where you are working. If you're a student, this would the be the `LDSSA/batch-...` repo. Remember to check first if the issue already exists!  

If it doesn't exist, click _New Issue_, and write it in a clear and comprehensive way. Remember to make the title make sense for those who are searching for it (for instance, don't use _"Question in LU2"_ as a title).
  
After you have written your issue, label it accordingly (what Learning Unit is it about? Is it a `bug` or a `clarification`? Is it about `SLU3`, `SLU7` or `SLU10`?). Unlabelled issues might go unnoticed!  

![labels](https://image.ibb.co/gyXkw7/Screen_Shot_2018_05_03_at_2_03_59_PM.png)

Once you open the issue, instructors will get notified, so keep an eye out for answers. Once you have an answer, give feedback as to whether it solved your problem. 

# How to give help 
Yay! You rock! 

### Make yourself available during the bootcamp [for non-remote editions]

### Direct to the right place 
Remember, it is easier to ask you on Slack than to do raise an issue. However there is a reason why we have this system: keeping track of questions, and making sure they only get asked once. If a student asks you a question and it isn't a quick answer, direct them to [the right place](#how-to-ask-for-help). Alternatively if you find that it's easier to answer then and there, [raise the issue](#how-to-open-an-issue) yourself and answer it. 

Let's not be na√Øve: now that you've answered, the student isn't raising it anymore ;) 

### Do not give the answer to exercises!
Remember the [hints not answers](../../About us/Code-of-Conduct#hints-not-answers) policy in the code of conduct. Explain the general case, point them towards the place where something is explained, but don't tell them the answer to a Exercise Notebook question.

### Check issues regularly 
While the Learning Units are going on, issues will pop-up. If we all contribute by checking them regularly and answering as we can, the response time will be excellent, and the effort shared by all. 

### Police the issues and slack channels for answers
This is not the most fun part of our work, but be on the alert for answers to Exercises (sometimes with the best of intentions). If you find [code that is an answer to a graded Exercise](../../About us/Code-of-Conduct#academic-integrity-on-all-assignments-and-exercises), feel free to delete it. Warn the student not to repeat it, and if it is a repeated offender inform the head teacher to take action.
