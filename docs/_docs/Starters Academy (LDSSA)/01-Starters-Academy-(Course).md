The Data Science Starters Academy is a series of events dedicated to helping people become entry-level data scientists, by teaching introductory material. 

As of its fourth edition (2020) it consists of approximately 30 Learning Units, 6 Hackathons and 1 capstone project. It contains 3 units to be done 
during the admission process, see more about it in the [admission process](../../Applicants/Application-process). This is the 5th edition (starting 2021) 
and it is the second to be held remotely, following the guidelines recommended by the portuguese government and the world health organization.

_The **Data Science Starters Academy** should not be mistaken for the 
[Lisbon Data Science Academy](../../About us/Lisbon-Data-Science-Academy-(Organization)), which 
is the organization responsible for running the course._


## Structure 
The Starters Academy lasts approximately 40 weeks of part-time work over the course of 8 months. 
Of that time, there are 9 days where we request of you to be virtually present (usually on Sundays), 
and the rest is done remote via GitHub, Slack and the Academy's grading and submission system. 
*You do not need to quit your primary responsibility to take part in this course.*

The curriculum can be referenced via the [curriculum-development repo](https://github.com/LDSSA/curriculum-development).

### Time commitment
You should be prepared to spend a recommended *10 hours per week* on the course and an absolute minimum of *5 hours per week* in case you are having a busy week.


### Introduction session

The introduction session is a 2-hour session that kicks off the academy. 

In this session all rules and schedule 
present in this page will be presented, together with any practical details for the current batch. Additionally 
we will go over the following topics:

* Code of Conduct
* How to ask for and give help
* Bootcamp Experience
* Criteria for Graduation
* Member Directory


### Bootcamp Details

The _Bootcamp_ is a 2-day event. The first hackathon is 
three weeks after the bootcamp.

During the _Bootcamp_ the students and teachers will participate virtually in a series of 
presentation and exercises, about 10 hours per day, and the students will go through 14 _Small 
Learning Units_. 

Even though this is a remote edition, we expect everyone to be virtually present during the full 
length of the bootcamp. Note that these are 2 intensive days where you should be available for the 
10 hour period below so make sure to get a good amount of rest!

**If you miss the Bootcamp or Hackathon #1, you won't be allowed to participate in any other Starters 
Academy activities.** 


### Specializations 
Specializations are sets of _Learning Units_ and _Hackathons_, focusing on specific themes.

The **first** specialization consists of:
- 3 SLUs that are covered during the admissions process (see [here](../../Applicants/Application-process#admission-tests))
- 14 SLUs that are covered during the Bootcamp
- 2 optional SLUs with extra content
- Hackathon #1 about Binary Classification

Each of the **remaining 5 specializations** consists of:
- 3 BLUs
- 1 hackathon

In order to participate in an hackathon, the student must have completed all the LUs for that 
specialization, with a minimum score of 80%.


### Learning Units 
_Learning Units_ (LUs) are the backbone of the Academy coursework.
There are two types of LUs: Small Learning Units (SLUs) and Big Learning Units (BLUs).


#### Small Learning Units (SLUs)
SLUs are the LUs that we use during the Bootcamp. They consist of:
1. A presentation
1. A learning notebook, which explains the concepts in detail and shows how to solve the 
problems
1. An example notebook, which summarizes the concepts so that it can be accessed quickly in 
the future
1. An exercise notebook, which contains graded challenges for the students to solve, and some 
optional extra exercises.

We take about 1 hour to go through an SLU on the Bootcamp, but students will need to revisit 
them later, to review the contents and finish the exercises.

#### Big Learning Units (SLUs)
BLUs are longer LUs that are used during the specializations. They consist of:

1. 3 learning notebooks (usually), which explains the concepts in great detail and shows how to 
solve the problems
1. An exercise notebook, which contains graded challenges for the students to solve, and some 
optional extra exercises.

Each specialization has 3 BLUs. It takes about 10 hours to go through the contents and solve 
the exercises of each of those BLUs.


### Hackathons 

_Hackathons_ are longer and less structured exercises, always done in teams, in which the students 
must complete a relatively advanced project. Hackathons require the students to make use of the 
skills they learned in the _Learning Units_, but also to excel at teamwork and communication. 
Hackathons are graded both on the technical performance of the teams and on their presentation / 
communication. 

Hackathons consist of: 
1. A set of instructions 
1. A submissions platform for students to submit their answers 
1. A presentations stage, where each team must present their methodology 
1. A leaderboard for students to know where they stand in the rankings

There are 6 hackathons in total, held on selected Sundays throughout the academy. To attend
the hackathon of a specialization you must deliver all units of that module until the deadline - 23h59 (Lisbon time) 
of the day before the hackathon. This ensures all teams and their members have the minimum 
knowledge required to participate. If you do not do this, you loose the access to the hackathon day. 
However, you may be eligible to deliver it late (see [Late delivery](#late-delivery))

At the end of every hackathon, we share some tips and a baseline solution provided by instructors.
This solution is not meant to be the top-performing solution as per the score. Instead, it is meant to be
a set of baseline steps and techniques that make sense in the context of the taught materials, and as such, 
that would have led to at least a good performance. The baseline solution is released on the day
after the hackathon so students can study it and iterate on it on their own pace.

#### Example structure
- 8h30 - Session open for students to join
- 9h00 - Hackathon Prompt, Team Assignment
- 9h30 - Start hacking!
- 12h30 - Lunch time
- 14h00 - Goal - make first submission
- 15h00 - Goal - make improved submission
- 16h00 - Start Working on Presentation
- 17h00 - Stop Hacking!
- 17h30 - Team Presentations
- 18h20 - Instructor's Presentation
- 18h30 - Winners Announced
- 18h45 - Closing Remarks
- 20h00 - Remote Networking and Beers



### Capstone
The _Capstone_ is the final project, where students will put everything they've learned together. 
The _Capstone_ must be completed individually.


## Late delivery

The capstone, Bootcamp days and Hackathon #1 are strictly mandatory and have hard deadlines. The 
remaining specializations are slightly more flexible. As described [Final Certificate](#final-certificate), you can miss at most one specialization, and you can deliver at most one specialization
late. Late deliveries offer a small extension to the deadline of a specialization. They provide 
a second chance in case you fall behind or find yourself unable to attend a hackathon for other
reasons.

In a late delivery we extend the original deadline by 2 weeks. For example, if 
a specialization ends with the hackathon on the 11th of August, the normal deadline for the units
would be August 10th, 23h59. However, if you missed the hackathon/units and decide to deliver late, 
you can now deliver all the evaluation elements - units and the hackathon - until August 24th, 23h59. 
To complete the late delivery you must do the following:
- Submit the units with passing grade to portal until the new deadline
- Send the code you did for the hackathon work until the new deadline
- Send the presentation (or presentation link) for the hackathon until the new deadline
- Show up to present on a defined date, which will be available on the calendar

As covered in [Hackathons](#hackathons) we share a baseline solution at the end of every 
hackathon, and release it on the repository the next day. We trust that students will not
copy these steps on their late delivery. If it is detected that a late delivery is just 
a copy of the baseline, that is considered a violation of our  [code of conduct](../../About us/Code-of-Conduct) 
and it will be automatically considered failed.


## Final Certificate

We think that the most important thing you'll take out of the Academy will be the things you'll learn and the people 
you'll meet. But we recognize that a lot of people value a certificate stating that they've participated and completed
the course. So, we emit a Data Science Resume representing the student's degree of completion of the Academy.

This resume will list all the Starters Academy's specializations, explain what it means to pass 
each specialization, and show the grades that you've achieved in each of them. If you 
miss a specialization, you'll score 0 (zero) on that specialization, and this will be 
shown in your resume. Late deliveries are shown in the same way as normal ones. 

You'll only be issued a Data Science Resume if:
* You attended the Bootcamp and Hackathon#1
* You deliver and pass the capstone report
* You missed 0 or 1 of the remaining specializations
* You delivered 0 or 1 of the remaining specializations late 

 Certificates have an expected issuing time from 1 to 3 months from the end of the academy.
