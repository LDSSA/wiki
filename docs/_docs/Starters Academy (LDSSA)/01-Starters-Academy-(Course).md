The **Data Science Starters Academy** is an introductory course in data science, designed to help people become entry-level data scientists. 

As of its seventh edition (2023) it consists of 34 Learning Units, 5 Hackathons and 1 capstone project. It contains 3 units to be done 
during the admission process, see more about it in the [admission process](../../Applicants/Application-process). This is the fourth edition held remotely.

_The **Data Science Starters Academy** should not be mistaken for the 
[Lisbon Data Science Academy](../../About us/Lisbon-Data-Science-Academy-(Organization)), which 
is the organization responsible for running the course._


## 1. Structure 
The Starters Academy lasts 34 weeks of part-time work over the course of 8 months. 
Of that time, there are 8 days where we request you to be virtually present (usually on Sundays).
The rest is done remotely via GitHub, Slack and the Academy's grading and submission system. 
*You do not need to quit your primary responsibility to take part in this course.*

The curriculum can be referenced via the [curriculum-development repo](https://github.com/LDSSA/curriculum-development).

### 1.1 Time commitment
You should be prepared to spend about *10 hours per week* on the course and an absolute minimum of *5 hours per week* in case you are having a busy week. The weekly time requirements might be higher during specialization 1 and the capstone project.

### 1.2 Introductory session

The introduction session is a 2-hour session that kicks off the academy. 

In this session, all the rules of the Academy
will be presented, together with any practical details for the current batch. Additionally, 
we will go over the following topics:

* Course structure and schedule
* Code of conduct
* How to ask for and give help
* Criteria for graduation

### 1.3 Bootcamp Details

The _Bootcamp_ are two days with virtual classes presented by the Academy instructors, about 4 hours on each day. It will take place on two consecutive Sunday mornings.

**The participation in the bootcamp is obligatory for graduation.**

### 1.4 Specializations 
Specializations are sets of _Learning Units_ and _Hackathons_, focusing on specific themes.

The **first** Specialization consists of:
- 3 SLUs that are covered during the admissions process (see [here](../../Applicants/Application-process#admission-tests))
- 14 SLUs that include classes presented during the Bootcamp
- 2 optional SLUs with extra content
- Hackathon #1 about Binary Classification - **participation in Hackathon #1 is obligatory for graduation**

Each of the **remaining 4 Specializations** consists of:
- 3 BLUs
- 1 hackathon

There is an additional optional Specialization that you can study on your own. It does not include a hackathon and there is no allocated time for it in the Academy schedule.

### 1.5 Learning Units 
_Learning Units_ (LUs) are the backbone of the Academy coursework.
There are two types of LUs: Small Learning Units (SLUs) and Big Learning Units (BLUs).

#### 1.5.1 Small Learning Units (SLUs)
SLUs are the LUs that we use in Specialization 1. They consist of:
1. A virtual class during the bootcamp
1. A learning notebook which explains the concepts and the coding details and shows how to solve the 
problems
1. An example notebook which summarizes the concepts and shows code examples
1. An exercise notebook which contains graded exercises for the students to solve and some 
optional extra exercises.

#### 1.5.2 Big Learning Units (SLUs)
BLUs are longer LUs that are used in Specializations 2-6. They consist of:

1. Up to 3 learning notebooks which explain the concepts and the coding details and show how to 
solve the problems
1. An exercise notebook which contains graded exercises for the students to solve and some 
optional extra exercises.

### 1.6 Hackathons 

In order to participate in a hackathon, the student must complete all the LUs for the given
Specialization with a minimum score of 16/20.

_Hackathons_ are longer and less structured team exercises in which the students 
receive a data set and solve a data science problem. Hackathons require the students to apply the 
skills they learned in the _Learning Units_, but also to communicate and manage work in a team and finally present
their solution to other students and the instructors.
Hackathons are graded both on the technical performance and on the solution presentation. 

The hackathon instructors present their own solution and share some tips. This solution is not meant to be the 
top-performing solution, but a good set of baseline steps and techniques that make sense in the context of the specialization topic.
This instructor solution will be published on the day
after the hackathon so that students can study it and iterate on it on at their own pace.

There are 5 hackathons in total, held on selected Sundays throughout the academy. To attend
the hackathon of a specialization, you must deliver all the learning units until the specialization deadline.

#### 1.6.1 Example hackathon structure
- 8h30 - Session opening
- 9h00 - Hackathon prompt, team assignment
- 9h30 - Start hacking!
- 12h30 - Lunch time
- 14h00 - Goal - make the first submission
- 15h00 - Goal - improve your score
- 16h00 - Prepare your presentation
- 17h00 - Stop hacking!
- 17h30 - Student presentations
- 18h20 - Instructor presentation
- 18h30 - Winners announced
- 18h45 - Closing remarks, remote networking

### 1.7 Capstone
The _Capstone_ is the final project where students will put everything they've learned together. It simulates a real-life data science project. The students receive a data set and a 'client' research question. They have to understand the client requirements, analyze the data set, create a model and client interface, and write a report.
The _Capstone_ must be completed individually.

## 2. Graduation certificate

We think that the most important thing you gain from the Academy will be the new knowledge and the people 
you'll meet. But we recognize that a lot of people value a certificate stating that they've participated and completed
the course. So, we emit a certificate to confirm the student's completion of the Academy.

The certificate will list all the Starters Academy's specializations, explain what it means to pass 
each specialization, and show the grades that you've achieved in each of them. 

You'll be issued a final certificate if:
* You delivered all the learning units with the minimal required score of 16/20
* You attended the virtual classes in Specialization #1 and Hackathon #1
* You missed 0 or 1 of the remaining hackathons
* You delivered and passed the capstone report

Certificates have an expected issuing time of 1 month from the end of the academy.
