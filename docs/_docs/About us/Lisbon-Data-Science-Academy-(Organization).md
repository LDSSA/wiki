The Lisbon Data Science Academy (_"The Academy"_ or _"LDSA"_) is a not-for-profit organization. 

It was started in June 2017 by a group of [volunteers](#founders) who love data science. The organization runs the [Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy](../../Starters Academy (LDSSA)/Starters-Academy-(Course)/), a course for python programmers who wish to enter Data Science, and offers a [Data Science Prep Course](../../DS Prep Course/Data-Science-Prep-Course/).
