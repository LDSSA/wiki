# Purpose of AORs

The purpose of defining Areas of Responsibility is so that when a task needs to get done:

1. The task can be unambiguously assigned to someone;
1. Someone is responsible for ensuring that the task is done;
1. The task doesn't end up in no-mans-land.

If we can control for these 3 factors, the enjoyment of volunteer work for the Academy should stay much higher. Remember, we don't want tasks to be a source of stress so the process of distributing them and executing on them should have the smallest number of ambiguous steps as possible.

# What exactly is an AOR?

An Area of Responsibility corresponds to a type of job that needs to be done in order for LDSA to achieve its mission. This kind of organization design is obviously not an exact science and there will always be tasks that don't clearly fall into one Area. But we need to have a starting point and this is it!

## Primary Enabler
Each AOR needs to have a face associated with it and this is the Primary Enabler!  
This is a single person who is responsible for making sure that tasks that fall into their area get done. **Not necessarily performing the tasks themselves!** Although the Primary Enabler will execute many tasks that are in their area, you can and should delegate tasks by assigning people and due dates to the tasks.  
You can see who the primary enabler is on the [Member directory](../Member-Directory)

## Slack channel
This is where you have any discussions that are short-lived or quick questions.

## Documentation
Virtually all work produced by an AOR should be accessible for all internal staff in one or more of the following locations:
- public and/or private LDSSA repo;
- our GoogleDrive and Calendar;
- this Wiki.

# Areas of Responsibility in detail
Each of the following is an area of responsibility with a brief description of the kinds of tasks. 


### Organization Administration  
[Primary enabler](../LDSA-Areas-of-Responsibility/#organizational-structure)

- This includes writing job descriptions, getting bank account, strategies are written


### Curriculum Development
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory#organizational-structure)  
- Define what concepts should be taught

  instructors and making sure that they get done on schedule.
- Ensuring that guest instructors clearly understand what is
  expected of them and make realistic commitments.

### Community  
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory#organizational-structure)  
Why do we need one?
- Academy’s mission is about building and maintaining a community. We have the teaching and learning part on the right track, what needs to be done now is to work on the community part which is now the #1 priority of the academy.
- As of yet, we have not developed our community the way that we would like so it is key to improve upon this.
- Most of us are good at teaching and learning but not that great at anything else, we really need some help. 
What will you do?
- Maintain regular engagement with the existing student and instructor base.
- Create engagement with the data science community at large
- Managing the internal communication channels
- Providing adequate gifs
- Be sufficiently engaged with the community to have an insiders view
- Create and manage the student slack
- Tell us anything else that should be on this list
What are the rewards?
- Access to the data scientists in Lisbon
- Sense of smugness
What are the expectations?
- Help us define the role
- We expect you to be a transformational element that makes tangible progress towards achieving the mission
- We need help discovering the best way to do community management
Activities
- The low-level details about what you will be doing we don’t know yet. We will need to and would very much like to work with you to define exactly what needs to be done on a day-to-day basis.




### Dev-Ops  
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory/#organizational-structure)  
- Ensuring that students can set up their machines
- Ensuring auto-grading infrastructure availability
- Hosting and running the hackathons

### Documentation
After a few years of operations, we have accumulated a large amount of knowledge and information. To avoid this exists inside the heads of a few people, Documentation AOR exists to ensure that volunteers can find what they need easily to do their jobs well. It's important to stress that this AOR doesn't need to necessarily document everything, but rather identify what's missing and get other AORs to update their parts. 

Right now we're storing information in 3 different places:
- Wiki: public, contains all required rules and final processes that we want to expose for transparency
- Google Drive Index: private, like meeting docs, extra things like evaluation spreadsheets, etc
- Google Calendar (Staff + Students): private to staff + students, contains all important dates and deadlines

Main responsibilities are:
- Organize the structure of the wiki and Google Drive Index
- Encourage and ensure the whole organization to document important information/decisions and they are up-to-date
   * Creation of new documentation
   * Review and update of stale/obsolete docs

### Finance  
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory/#organizational-structure)  
- TODO

### Marketing and Communications

[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory/#organizational-structure)  
- Ensure that visibility and credibility of the academy is communicated
- Identify target audiences
- Set and execute communication strategies for audiences
- Answer or route questions that come in on open channels (info@, fb messenger, etc)
- Work on communication strategies (need to be defined what this means)
- Maintain the unbounce page

### Operations
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory#organizational-structure). 
We hold 6 events per batch in which we need wifi, food, outlets, desks, chairs, and good ambiance coordinated
for each one of the. The most intensive event is the 3-day bootcamp in which we hold 3 10-hour days that provide
breakfast and lunch per day. The rest of the events are single-day 10 hour hackathons that have similar
requirements as the bootcamp but are much easier because they are single-day events.

Typically, each event is sponsored by a particular company. The company may or may not sponsor food / drinks 
for the event. If they do sponsor it, you will need to coordinate with them and help them as much as possible 
in order to increase the chances of them sponsoring future events. If they don't sponsor food and drinks,
you will need to arrange the food and make sure that it is delivered on time. We have a few catering companies
that we have been working with and have a good relationship with.

In summary, your responsibilities are:

- To ensure that events run well. The requirements for events may change slightly and the vast majority of the
effort is concentrated at the beginning of the batch with the bootcamp.
- Communicating with hackathon and bootcamp hosts to ensure delivery of things like food and internet connection are present.

### Partnerships  
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory/#organizational-structure)  
The Partnerships team should ensure that any relationship that we have with other companies or organizations stay healthy and are in line with the charter. You must also ensure that expectations for both organizations are in line and that it is a worthwhile experience. 

Some specific tasks in this are are:  
- When we are contacted by outside organizations, they receive a polite, warm, and professional greeting.
- Any time that an existing member wants to propose a partnership with an outside organization, you will take over the process or help guide them through it should they prefer to stay as the primary contact.
- After sponsored events, following up with the sponsor and make sure that their expectations were and continue to be met.



### Quality Assurance  
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory/#organizational-structure)  
The core product of the Starters Academy is the educational material. Unexpected issues such as bugs in the code
or an exercise that is unclear and is likely to cause lots of confusion cause significant problems because of the number of people involved. In past academies, we have lost many man-hours fixing learning units after they have been released to the students.

This area of responsibility is to ensure that no obvious mistakes make it into any learning material that is delivered to students. Less obvious things such as subtle mistakes in spelling or grammar or maybe even a contradiction of an earlier learning unit should be looked for but are not nearly as important to catch as bugs or totally incorrect questions.

Some specific tasks are:
- Making sure that notebooks run before they are released to the students
- Making sure that a notebook accepts the correct answers
- Doing one final reading of any material before it is released to find obvious issues

### Student Success
[Primary enabler](../Member-Directory#organizational-structure)  
- Ensuring that students have a path to success
- Gathering feedback from students
- Making sure students have a voice and can be heard


# Final Notes
If you have issues deciding where a task should go, feel free to contact the [primary enabler of Organization Administration](../Member-Directory/#organizational-structure) directly! It is that person's responsibility to make sure that everyone is happily contributing :-)
