# Purpose of AORs

The purpose of defining Areas of Responsibility is so that when a task needs to get done:

1. The task can be unambiguously assigned to someone;
1. Someone is responsible for ensuring that the task is done;
1. The task doesn't end up in no-mans-land.

If we can control for these 3 factors, the enjoyment of volunteer work for the Academy should stay much higher. Remember, we don't want tasks to be a source of stress so the process of distributing them and executing on them should have the smallest number of ambiguous steps as possible.

# What exactly is an AOR?

An Area of Responsibility corresponds to a type of job that needs to be done in order for LDSA to achieve its mission. This kind of organization design is obviously not an exact science and there will always be tasks that don't clearly fall into one Area. But we need to have a starting point and this is it!

## Primary Enabler
Each AOR needs to have a face associated with it and this is the Primary Enabler!  
This is a single person who is responsible for making sure that tasks that fall into their area get done. **Not necessarily performing the tasks themselves!** Although the Primary Enabler will execute many tasks that are in their area, you can and should delegate tasks by assigning people and due dates to the tasks.  
You can see who the primary enabler is on the [Member directory](../Member-Directory)
