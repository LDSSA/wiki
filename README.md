# Lisbon Data Science Academy Wiki

Welcome to the Wiki! You should (in theory) be able to find the answer to anything Academy-related here. Please note there are separate sections for [**the organization (LDSA)**](pages/Lisbon-Data-Science-Academy-(Organization).md) and for the [**Starters Academy Course (LDSSA)**](pages/Starters-Academy-(Course).md). 

If you are thinking of applying, please read the [**Application Process**](pages/Application-process.md) and the [**Code of Conduct**](pages/Code-of-Conduct.md) carefully. To be notified when the applications open, [**leave your email here**](http://www.lisbondatascience.org/).

### Didn't find what you were looking for? 
Should you not find the information you are looking for on this Wiki (not even in [**the great and powerful FAQ**](pages/FAQ.md)), please [**raise an issue**](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/issues), so that we can answer while completing the info for everyone else, too.
